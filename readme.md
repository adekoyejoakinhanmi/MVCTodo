# MVCTodo
		
MVCTodo is my attempt to implement some features of the TodoMVC project enirely on my own using ES6. 

## Design

The app simply implements the all the features of the TodoMVC project except for routing and localStorage. 

## Aim

The main aim was to help me understand and implement OOP and MVC. Initally, I had tried to write the app in 2016 but these concepts proved elusive to me. I have since then learnt more about JavaScript and as such rewritten the entire app in ES6 using features such as:

- Destructuring
- Module bundling
- Template Strings
- `class` syntax etc.

The app is bundled by Webpack.

## Improvements

- I am not very happy with the way my methods are exposed - perhaps as I encounter more well written code, I'd learn to write even better JavaScript
- The styling can be improved for better user experience.
- Data persistence and locationHash change are definitely worth it.
